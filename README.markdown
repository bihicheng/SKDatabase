This is library is designed to help you access a SQLite database from Objective-C. 
I've only tested this on the iPhone, but I guess it should work on the Mac as well.

Based on works originally found @
http://iphoneinaction.manning.com/iphone_in_action/2009/07/skdatabase-11-a-sqlite-library-for-the-iphone.html
Unfortunantly that website is no longer around.
If memory serves me correctly the original author released it into the public domain.

I have also made some of my own (minor) modifications to the library, and I also intend
to contribute to the code base going forward (hence the github repo).

Getting Started:

To use this library you will also need to reference the libsqlite3.0.dylib library.
